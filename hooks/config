# Each pre-commit hook below is executed on each `git commit`.
# The tools decide if they are relevant, exiting early if they are not.
# Every tool that runs prints one of two exit messages; "ok", or some error.
# If a tools name is not listed in standard output but is in this list, the tool
# exited early and did not run.

# The difference is that pre-push adds the results of the hooks
# as metadata to the commit, utilizing the git notes feature.
